# Milk_Instancer_Standard
 GPU Instancing in unity with culling and LOD


WIP - this is a version of Milk_Instancer01 that supports the Built in render pipeline. occlusion culling is currently broken, and ill fix it when i feel like it.

also in unity 2021.2, shadergraph now works in the built in render pipeline. however, something about it is super fucking gay, and the setup i use for indirect instancing doesnt work with it, even tho it does in urp and hdrp
